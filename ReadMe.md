# 🗺️ Mapping Survival and Mortality Trends of COVID-19: A Global Perspective

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 trends, focusing on mortality and recovery patterns across countries. Using over **12.5 million rows of raw, messy data**, I cleaned, transformed, and visualized key indicators to uncover insights into the pandemic’s global footprint.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess a massive dataset of global COVID-19 statistics
- Identify the **top 10 countries by total deaths**
- Highlight the **top 10 most affected countries by confirmed cases**
- Create **choropleth maps** to visualize:
  - Total deaths across **221 countries**
  - Recovery numbers across **19 countries** (due to missing data in others)

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Highlights
- Parsed and validated over **12.5 million records** from multiple sources
- Handled missing values, inconsistent formats, and country-level aggregation
- Ensured accurate alignment of cumulative metrics (confirmed, deceased, recovered)

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Top 10 countries by total deaths** include: United States, Brazil, India, Russia, Mexico, and others
- **Top 10 most affected countries by confirmed cases** include: United States, India, France, Germany, Brazil, etc.
- Recovery data was only available for **19 countries**, requiring selective mapping and annotation

## 🌍 Visualizations
- **Global Choropleth Map of Total Deaths**  
  Highlights mortality intensity across 221 countries

- **Global Choropleth Map of Recoveries**  
  Focused view of recovery trends where data was available

- **Bar Charts**  
  Top 10 countries by deaths and confirmed cases

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python: `pandas`, `numpy`, `plotly`, `cufflinks`
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel (for initial filtering and validation)
- GeoJSON (for choropleth mapping)

---
## ⚠️ Limitations
- Recovery data was missing for most countries, limiting global completeness
- Death rates may be affected by underreporting or inconsistent testing policies

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integrate vaccination data for survival analysis
- Explore time-series trends and variant-specific impacts
- Expand recovery mapping as more data becomes available
